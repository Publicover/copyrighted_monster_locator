== POCKET MONSTER LOCATOR

This app is a database of locations from the new mobile game Pokemon Go. It tracks which monsters appear at which locations. Each address can be run through the Google Geolocation API to produce an embedded map. Anyone can view the information (including the Google Maps functions) but users must be signed in to create and destroy records. It works on mobile but has not been optimized for ios. Right now, locations are locked down to cities where data testers live: Durham, Greensboro and Ashtabula (Ohio). 

It has been deployed to heroku at pocketmonsterlocator.herokuapp.com.
